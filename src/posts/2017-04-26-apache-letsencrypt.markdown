I have been hearing about [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for a while, and luckily enough I have the opportunity to get my hands on it (virtually, of course).

In this post, I will talk about my experience setting up a simple demo [website](https://demo-apache.chriswang.tech/) over HTTPS using Let's Encrypt on an Apache HTTP Server. The entire process takes less than <30 mins if you get the following right before you start:

* You have an AWS account and are familiar with basic concepts like EC2, VPC, Security Group etc.
* You are familar with Bash/Shell
* You controls an active top-level domain and are familiar with the configuration

An import note before we start: The website is purely for demonstration purpose and not suitable for production use.

## Here are the steps to do it
### Create EC2 instance
An AWS EC2 `t2.micro` instance is setup. And an elastic IPv4 address (`34.202.12.128`) is assigned and attached to the EC2 instance's network interface.

### Update Name Server

A DNS `A` record is added to my Name Server for chriswang.tech and pointing to `34.202.12.128`. In my case, Cloudflare's DNS is used.

 The configuration is shown below.

![dns]({{ site.url }}/images/dns.png)

The `dig` command is used to verify that the DNS record has taken effect in my local DNS resolver.

```bash
$ dig demo-apache.chriswang.tech
```

### Test HTTP
To verify the Apache HTTP service works, visit in the browser`http://demo-apache.chriswang.tech`.

An Apache Default Page below is expected.

![default_apache]({{ site.url }}/images/default_apache.png)



### Update `index.html`

To update the default page, a custom `index.html` is created and symlinked to the default Apache directory at `/var/www/html/` using the following command:

`$ sudo ln -s ~/demo-apache/index.html /var/www/html/index.html`

The following webpage should be shown after refreshing the same URL in browser.

![index_html]({{ site.url }}/images/index_html.png)

### Generate Private Key

The RSA private key and certificate signing request (CSR) are generated using `openssl` using the following command:

`$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr`

The generated CSR will be used for the TLS public certificate generation in the next step.

### Configure Let's Encrypt/CertBot

In order to use Let's Encrypt, the CertBot is installed to automate this process using the following commands:
```bash
$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache
```

The TLS certificate generation and Apache HTTP Server are executed automatically by running the following command:


```bash
$ certbot --apache 
```

If successful, an output similar to the following is expected:

    Congratulations! You have successfully enabled
    https://demo-apache.chriswang.tech
    
    You should test your configuration at:

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
     - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
       /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo-apache.chriswang.tech/fullchain.pem.
       Your cert will expire on 2017-07-25. To obtain a new or tweaked
       version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
       with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
       your certificates, run "certbot renew"
     - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
    
       Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
       Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

### Run Qualys SSL Server Test

To verify that the the HTTPS/TLS service is configured correctly, the [Qualys SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=demo-apache.chriswang.tech) is run. 

The test report is shown below with a big green **A**. It means the HTTPS/TLS is working as expected! ðŸ˜€

![ssl_report]({{ site.url }}/images/ssl_report.png)



## The experience is great: straight-forward and FREE

Kudos and thanks to the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), Linux Foundation, Apache Foundation and many other non-profit and commercial organizations for making HTTPS/TLS accessible for everyone.

We look forward to more projects like this!

/Chris
